GrimesAI – Project Overview
1. Executive Summary

GrimesAI is a persona-based AI chat application designed to create immersive, character-driven conversations. Instead of functioning like a typical chatbot, it allows users to interact with distinct AI personas powered by Google Gemini.

The system combines a cinematic dark interface with real-time AI responses to make conversations feel more natural, engaging, and personalized.

2. Purpose of the Project

Most AI chat systems feel generic and text-heavy. They respond correctly, but they lack personality and emotional depth.

GrimesAI was created to explore how interface design and AI personality modeling can work together. The goal is to build a system where:

The environment matches the intelligence of the AI

Users can select a specific character persona

The AI adjusts tone and response style based on user identity settings

This makes the experience feel less like querying a machine and more like having a conversation.

3. System Architecture & Technology

Framework: React + Vite (Single Page Application)
Styling: Tailwind CSS with a custom dark “Anti-Gravity” theme
AI Engine: Google Gemini API for response generation and contextual reasoning
